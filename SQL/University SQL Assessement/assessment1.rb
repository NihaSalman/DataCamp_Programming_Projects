# It is students responsibility to install and configure software systems where they choose to consider other methods of running the file.
# Warning, student marks will only be based on results produced when running submissions on the University's VDI resource.
# The command 'ruby sqlcaa01_xx.rb' (where xx is the version number) should be used to run the SQL statements and check whether they produce the correct results.
# This can be performed as many times as one likes before submitting.
# Once submitted to Myaberdeen this will count for an attempt.
